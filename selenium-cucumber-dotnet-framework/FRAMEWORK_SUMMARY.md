### Sample Test Scenario (BDD Format)
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a user of the .NET application
  I want to be able to login with my credentials
  So that I can access the application functionality

  @smoke @dotnet @critical
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid username "testuser" and password "Test@123"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be successfully logged in
    And I should see the welcome message
```

## Execution Capabilities

### Command Line Operations
```bash
# Execute smoke tests
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke"

# Run regression tests in headless mode
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@regression" -Dheadless=true
